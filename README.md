# Advent of Code

There once was an engineer named Jia Min

Who tackled the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) with a grin

She coded all day

And never lost her way

Solving puzzles with skill, she'd always win

Her code was neat and her logic was sound

She never let any bugs linger around

She'd debug and she'd test

Until she passed the rest

Jia Min, a true coding queen crowned

So if you're a coder, just like Jia Min

Don't hesitate, join in the fun

The Advent of Code

Is a great abode

For those who love coding, it's a win!
